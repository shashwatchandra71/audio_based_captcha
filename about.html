                <p>Team 20 started audio captcha because the AI and ML developed bots could easily bypass the Text captcha.

                    That's why the team decided to build audio captcha that also helps visually impaired.
                    
                    Along the way, the team as a whole learned HTML,CSS and JavaScript, also developed communication skills.
                
                    We want to be able to develop audio captcha on a comercial level but for now its locally hosted.</p>
